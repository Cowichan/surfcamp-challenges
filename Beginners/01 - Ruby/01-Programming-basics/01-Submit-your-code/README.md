## Learning Badges
Are you able to answer the following questions ? If not, you're not ready to move on !

* Suppose you add a new file in your local code repo, what's the instruction to tell git to track this new file ?
* Once this file is tracked, how do you commit new changes you make to its content ?
* Suppose you have renamed or deleted a file which was already tracked by git. What are the steps to commit these changes ?
* Now suppose you messed up with a bunch of files (you have added new files, renamed or deleted old ones, each of them possibly already tracked by git..). What are the steps to make a proper commit ?
* How do you check that your status is clean and that you are ready to push your code on Github ?
* Finally, what's the command to push your code on Github ?
